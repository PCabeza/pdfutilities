pdf utilities
=============

Several projects that work with pdf files and improves them.

I needed to use many pdf files and it was tedious to work with them
using an ebook or pdf files consisting in just images. That is why I
decided to build some tools to help me with it.


- [pdfmetadata](src/master/pdfmetadata/): it allows you to add bookmarks and an
  index to the pdf, as well as re-labeling the pages (to simplify the
  *go-to-page* when reading the toc of the pdf).

- [pdfocr.py](src/master/pdfocr/): it adds text to pdf consisting in just images,
  allowing you to use the search functionality of pdf readers.
